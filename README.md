# Obstacle-Avoiding-Vehicle
An arduino based obstacle avoiding vehicle that is capable of moving in all the directions. This vehicle contains ultrasonic sensors through which the readings are taken and sent to aurdino for distance calculation. 
The ultrasonic sensors help the car to detect the objects around it and stops it before collision.
This is very helpful and it can serve as the prototype for self driving or driveless cars.
